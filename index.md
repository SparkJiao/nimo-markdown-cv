[[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00357)]
[[Code](https://github.com/SparkJiao/MERIt)]  
<!-- * The motivation of this work is to improve the generalization of neural logical reasoning models by devising task-oriented pre-training.   -->
<!-- * I complete almost all parts of this work. The other co-authors help me polish the paper writing.   -->

[[Code](https://github.com/SparkJiao/Retrieval-based-Pre-training-for-Machine-Reading-Comprehension)]  
<!-- * The motivation of this work is to alleviate the data hungry problem of machinea reading comprehension system.    -->
<!-- * We propose a retrieval-based pre-training method, including two pretext tasks, namely surrounding sentences prediction and retrieval-based masked language modeling, to augment the pre-trained language models with the ability of evidence extraction.    -->

[[Code](https://github.com/SparkJiao/LARCH)]  
<!-- * Existing works have overlooked the (1) the session structure in the conversational query, and (2) the multiform knowledge.   -->
<!-- * We devise a novel contextual image search scheme, LARCH, to facilitate conversational image search.  -->
<!-- * Besides, we construct a augmented dataset based on MMD to facilitate future research.   -->
<!-- * The main idea comes from Prof. Nie and Wenjie Wang. I have proposed several improvements to it, including: (1) increasing the edges of the constructed graph, (2) considering the session-related knowledge, and (3) introducing the gate mechanism.   -->
<!-- * In addition to the above suggestions, my main contributions to this work include system implemetation, experiments, the paper writing of methodology, dataset and experiments.    -->
